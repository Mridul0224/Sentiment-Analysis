Sentiment Analysis in Python
This Python script performs sentiment analysis on a dataset of reviews using various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and models, including NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and transformers like VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) and RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach).

Features
Data Reading and Exploration: Utilizes pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib, seaborn for data visualization.
Sentiment Analysis Techniques:
NLTK Basics: Tokenization, POS tagging, Named Entity Recognition.
VADER Sentiment Scoring: For obtaining negative, neutral, and positive sentiment scores.
RoBERTa Pretrained Model: Utilizing a model trained on a large corpus for sentiment analysis.
Comparison of Sentiment Scores: Between VADER and RoBERTa models.
BERT Sentiment Analysis: Additional sentiment analysis using a BERT model for multilingual sentiment analysis.
Visualization: Comparative visualization of sentiment analysis results.
